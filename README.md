This project focuses on implementing secure coding practices and security protocols learned throughout the course. It emphasizes the importance of integrating security from the very beginning of the software development lifecycle starting at the design phase rather than leaving it until the end. By adopting DevSecOps principles, we aim to reduce vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and ensure robust system security.
Key Highlights

Security by Design: Incorporating security measures early in development to allow proper testing and reduce attack surfaces.
Risk & Cost Analysis: Includes a detailed table assessing risk levels, severity, and cost benefit analysis to prioritize mitigation strategies.
Zero Trust Approach: Implements authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) frameworks, along with encryption at rest, in transit, and in use.
Secure Coding Standards: Practices that help minimize vulnerabilities and prevent costly breaches.

Goal
To demonstrate how proactive security measures and DevSecOps practices can protect systems, users, and organizations from potential threats while reducing financial and operational risks.

✅ Key Features

Comprehensive Coverage: Includes policies for access control, incident response, and data protection.
Customizable: Easily adapt to organizational needs.
Compliance Oriented: Aligns with frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and CIS.


🔍 Why This Matters
Security policies are the backbone of an organization’s cybersecurity posture. They define responsibilities, outline acceptable use, and mitigate risks by enforcing consistent practices. A well structured policy ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical assets.
